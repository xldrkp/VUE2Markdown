# VUE Markdown Generator (VUE2Markdown)

This little script generates a Markdown file from the remarks of nodes and links in a VUE concept map.

I recommend concept maps to my students to visualize complex topics and structures. VUE is not just good for 
visualizing but also for describing the nodes and the links. To do so one can use the *Info-Panel* with a right-click 
on a node or a link and enter remarks in the little text box. 

Unfortunately VUE's functions to export or print the map are insuffient. To compensate this I wrote this little Python 
script that generates a Markdown file which then can be converted to HTML, PDF or whatever. Have a look at the example 
PDF.

Right now it is neccessary to change names for input and output files directly in the code. Feel free to fork and enhance!
